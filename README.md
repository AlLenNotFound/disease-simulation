testResult.csv record the cost(running time) and accuracy(eval based on averageInfectious).

The test result report shows the accuracy and code running efficiency of different parameters under different value combinations.

we test the different set of parameter combinations like.

In general, according to the test results and data analysis, the change of dt will not cause huge cumulative errors in the accuracy of the results, 
but will significantly increase the computing cost; gamma and beta will not have too much impact on the computing cost, 
but when these two parameters are large, it will cause numerical instability and lead to numerical errors.
